# Description
This is the main API used for the Train A Pup app. This AWS-SAM Repo is responsible for registering users, handling user notifications, events, logins, and everything that the user can do on the main app. ([REACT NATIVE PROJECT](https://github.com/train-a-pup/tap-react))

I have left this project in pursuit of another project but this project shows my talents and what I can do in a couple of months.

## Screenshots
### Homepage
This page shows what upcoming events are coming and the details of the dog, you can add more events and make these events repeat in the calendar section.

### Training
Most of these are not images but rather they are gifs that are animated to show the user the actions that they should be doing

### Tricks
This page contains all of the tricks. These can be updated anytime without updating the app at all and there exists an admin panel for me to create these tricks and it will automatically update in the app.
